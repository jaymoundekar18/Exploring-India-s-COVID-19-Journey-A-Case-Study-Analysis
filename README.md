# Exploring-India-s-COVID-19-Journey-A-Case-Study-Analysis

This project is designed to provide valuable insights into the age-wise distribution of COVID-19 cases, as well as the trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and daily decreases in India. Furthermore, it aims to analyze state-wise data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, alongside information about available hospital beds, testing data, and population distribution. By uncovering meaningful insights from these datasets, this study aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 situation in India. This understanding will empower decision-makers and help develop effective strategies to combat the pandemic.

The project is structured into two modules:

Module 1: Data Pre-processing with Python

Module 2: Data Analysis using SQL

These modules collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently manage and extract insights from a database, making it a valuable learning opportunity.
